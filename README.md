# Mint Signup Page Clone

### Beginning 02.17.2021

Trying to copy the style of Mint's signup page (https://accounts.intuit.com/signup.html?offering_id=Intuit.ifs.mint&namespace_id=50000026&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmint.intuit.com%2Foverview.event%3Ftask%3DS)

### Finished 02.19.2021

Learned some new things about working/positioning list items and images and making sure _display: block;_ is what I need/want. Definitely worked a lot faster than with the Youtube clone even though I think it was a simpler project overall. The basics of html and css are starting to sink in and I have a few goto moves and tricks to try when things don't work...even though I really do end up Googling a lot of stuff to see how it all works.
